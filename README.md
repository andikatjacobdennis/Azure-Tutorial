## **CapEx vs. OpEx**

- **CapEx (Capital Expenditure):**  
  Refers to upfront investments in physical infrastructure or assets that the business owns and depreciates over time. For example:
  - Purchasing servers, data centers, and networking hardware.
  - Used when organizations prefer long-term cost benefits.
  - Advantage: Full control over infrastructure and predictable costs.

- **OpEx (Operational Expenditure):**  
  Refers to ongoing costs for using services or products. These are regular expenses incurred to operate a business. For example:
  - Paying for cloud services on a subscription or pay-as-you-go model.
  - Used when organizations need scalability and flexibility.
  - Advantage: Lower upfront cost and better cost predictability.

Azure, like most cloud platforms, enables organizations to shift from a CapEx model to an OpEx model by offering scalable, subscription-based services.

## **2. SLA (Service Level Agreement)**

An **SLA** is a formal contract between a service provider (Azure) and its customers that defines the expected level of service. Azure SLAs typically guarantee:
1. **Uptime**: The percentage of time a service is available.
2. **Performance**: Commitments to response times and throughput.
3. **Remedies**: Compensation (usually credits) for SLA breaches.

### Uptime SLA Table for Azure Services:
| **Service**                    | **Uptime Guarantee**  |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Virtual Machines**           | 99.9% (Single VM)    |
| **Storage Account**            | 99.9% - 99.99%       |
| **SQL Database (Basic)**       | 99.99%               |
| **Azure Kubernetes Service**   | 99.95%               |

### Uptime Example:
- **99.9% uptime** allows for 8.76 hours of downtime per year.
- **99.99% uptime** allows for only 52.56 minutes of downtime per year.

### Calculating Downtime from SLA:
To calculate downtime:
1. **Downtime (per month)** = (1 - Uptime%) Ã— Total Minutes in a Month.
2. Example:
   - For a 99.9% SLA: `(1 - 0.999) Ã— (30 days Ã— 24 hours Ã— 60 minutes)` = 43.2 minutes of allowed downtime.

---

## **3. SLA Calculator**

Azure provides an **SLA Calculator** to estimate the cumulative SLA for multiple services in a solution. If your application relies on multiple services, the combined SLA is lower than the individual SLAs.

### Combined SLA Formula:
\[
\text{Combined SLA} = \text{SLA(Service A)} \times \text{SLA(Service B)} \times \dots
\]

### Example:
An application using two services:
1. Service A: 99.95%
2. Service B: 99.9%

Combined SLA:
\[
99.95\% \times 99.9\% = 99.85\%
\]

You can use the [Azure SLA Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/sla-calculator/) to simplify this process.

## **Setting Up and Deploying a Web App**

### **Configuring Outbound IP Address**
An **outbound IP address** is used for your applicationâ€™s communication with external services. Azure assigns these automatically. You can configure a static outbound IP by integrating a NAT Gateway.

## **Deployment Slots**

**Deployment Slots** allow you to deploy and test a new version of your application without affecting the production environment.

### **Benefits of Deployment Slots:**
- Perform A/B testing by routing a percentage of traffic to different slots.
- Rollback seamlessly by swapping slots if an update fails.

### **Using Deployment Slots**
1. **Change Traffic Percentage:**
   - Adjust the percentage of traffic directed to a specific slot in the Azure Portal.

2. **Deploying via Azure in VS Code:**
   - Use the Azure App Service extension in VS Code to deploy to specific slots.
   - Connect VS Code to your Azure subscription and select the desired slot during deployment.

3. **Swap Slots:**
   - Swap the staging slot with production once the new version is verified.

## **Deployment Types**

### **Basic Deployment**
Deploy your application directly to the production environment. Suitable for small projects with minimal risk.

### **Rolling Deployment**
Deploy updates in small increments across instances to ensure no downtime.

### **Blue-Green Deployment**
Use two environments: one for the live application (blue) and one for the new version (green). After testing, switch traffic to the green environment.

## **Introduction to Containers**
Containers have revolutionized the way applications are developed, deployed, and managed. Below, we explore the basics of containers and their advantages over traditional virtual machines (VMs).

### **Containers vs. Virtual Machines (VMs)**
| **Feature**       | **Containers**                          | **Virtual Machines**                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Isolation**      | Lightweight process isolation           | Full OS-level isolation               |
| **Startup Time**   | Starts in seconds                       | Takes minutes                         |
| **Resource Usage** | Shares OS kernel; uses fewer resources  | Requires full OS; higher resource use |
| **Portability**    | Consistent across environments          | Limited portability                   |

### **Why Containers?**
- **Efficiency**: Containers are lightweight, starting quickly and using fewer resources.
- **Portability**: Applications bundled in containers run the same way in any environment, reducing "it works on my machine" issues.
- **Scalability**: Easy to scale horizontally, making containers ideal for microservices.

## **Introduction to Docker**

### **Docker Architecture**
Docker simplifies containerization by providing tools and a platform to build, ship, and run containers. Here's an overview of its components:

1. **Docker Client**: Used to interact with the Docker daemon (`docker build`, `docker run`).
2. **Docker Daemon (Engine)**: The core service managing containers, images, and networks.
3. **Containers**: Lightweight instances of images running in isolated environments.
4. **Images**: Immutable, pre-configured environments (OS, dependencies, application).
5. **Docker Registry**: A repository for storing and sharing container images. Examples include Docker Hub and Azure Container Registry.
6. **Dockerfile**: A text file containing instructions to build a Docker image.

### **Dockerfile**
A `Dockerfile` is essential for automating the creation of Docker images. Below is a simple example:

```dockerfile
# Use base image
FROM node:16

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy app source code
COPY . .

# Expose port
EXPOSE 3000

# Run the app
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Build an image using a `Dockerfile`:
```bash
docker build -t my-app:1.0 .
```

## **Introduction to Kubernetes (K8s)**
Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

### **Key Features**
- **Scalability**: Automatically scale containers based on demand.
- **Self-Healing**: Restarts failed containers and replaces unresponsive nodes.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across containers.
- **Declarative Management**: Desired states are defined in YAML files.

### **Basic Kubernetes Terminology**
- **Pod**: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes; often contains one container.
- **Node**: A worker machine in a Kubernetes cluster.
- **Cluster**: A set of nodes managed by a master node.
- **Deployment**: Manages pods and ensures desired states are maintained.

## **Building and Pushing Images with Azure**
### **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**
ACR is a private registry to store Docker images securely. Here's how to build and push an image:

```bash
az acr build --image cart:v1 --registry <REGISTRY NAME> --file Dockerfile .
```

### **Steps to Work with Containers in Azure**
1. **Install Docker in VS Code**
   - Install the Docker extension in Visual Studio Code.
   - Install Docker Desktop on your local machine.

2. **Build an Image**
   Use the Azure CLI to build a container image:
   ```bash
   az acr build --image <IMAGE_NAME> --registry <REGISTRY_NAME> --file Dockerfile .
   ```

3. **Push to Registry**
   Push the image to ACR or Docker Hub for sharing.

## **Working with AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)**
AKS simplifies the deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters in Azure.

### **Setup AKS Cluster**
1. **Install Kubernetes CLI**:
   ```bash
   az aks install-cli
   ```
2. **Set PATH**: Ensure `kubectl` is available in your system path.

3. **Authenticate with Azure**:
   ```bash
   az login
   ```

4. **Get Cluster Credentials**:
   Connect to your AKS cluster:
   ```bash
   az aks get-credentials --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <CLUSTER_NAME>
   ```

5. **Verify Nodes**:
   Ensure your cluster nodes are ready:
   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

6. **Deploy Applications**:
   Apply your Kubernetes deployment configuration:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   ```

### **Example deployment.yaml**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: cart-app
  labels:
    app: cart
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: cart
  template:
