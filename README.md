## **CapEx vs. OpEx**

- **CapEx (Capital Expenditure):**  
  Refers to upfront investments in physical infrastructure or assets that the business owns and depreciates over time. For example:
  - Purchasing servers, data centers, and networking hardware.
  - Used when organizations prefer long-term cost benefits.
  - Advantage: Full control over infrastructure and predictable costs.

- **OpEx (Operational Expenditure):**  
  Refers to ongoing costs for using services or products. These are regular expenses incurred to operate a business. For example:
  - Paying for cloud services on a subscription or pay-as-you-go model.
  - Used when organizations need scalability and flexibility.
  - Advantage: Lower upfront cost and better cost predictability.

Azure, like most cloud platforms, enables organizations to shift from a CapEx model to an OpEx model by offering scalable, subscription-based services.

## **2. SLA (Service Level Agreement)**

An **SLA** is a formal contract between a service provider (Azure) and its customers that defines the expected level of service. Azure SLAs typically guarantee:
1. **Uptime**: The percentage of time a service is available.
2. **Performance**: Commitments to response times and throughput.
3. **Remedies**: Compensation (usually credits) for SLA breaches.

### Uptime SLA Table for Azure Services:
| **Service**                    | **Uptime Guarantee**  |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Virtual Machines**           | 99.9% (Single VM)    |
| **Storage Account**            | 99.9% - 99.99%       |
| **SQL Database (Basic)**       | 99.99%               |
| **Azure Kubernetes Service**   | 99.95%               |

### Uptime Example:
- **99.9% uptime** allows for 8.76 hours of downtime per year.
- **99.99% uptime** allows for only 52.56 minutes of downtime per year.

### Calculating Downtime from SLA:
To calculate downtime:
1. **Downtime (per month)** = (1 - Uptime%) Ã— Total Minutes in a Month.
2. Example:
   - For a 99.9% SLA: `(1 - 0.999) Ã— (30 days Ã— 24 hours Ã— 60 minutes)` = 43.2 minutes of allowed downtime.

---

## **3. SLA Calculator**

Azure provides an **SLA Calculator** to estimate the cumulative SLA for multiple services in a solution. If your application relies on multiple services, the combined SLA is lower than the individual SLAs.

### Combined SLA Formula:
\[
\text{Combined SLA} = \text{SLA(Service A)} \times \text{SLA(Service B)} \times \dots
\]

### Example:
An application using two services:
1. Service A: 99.95%
2. Service B: 99.9%

Combined SLA:
\[
99.95\% \times 99.9\% = 99.85\%
\]

You can use the [Azure SLA Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/sla-calculator/) to simplify this process.
